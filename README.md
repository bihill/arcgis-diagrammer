# ArcGIS Diagrammer

ArcGIS Diagrammer is a productivity tool for GIS professionals to create, edit or analyze geodatabase schema. Schema is presented as editable graphics in an environment familiar to users of Microsoft Visual Studio. Essentially ArcGIS Diagrammer is a visual editor for Esriâ€™s xml workspace documents that can be created in ArcMap or ArcCatalog.

This project intends to update and republish ArcGIS Diagrammer for ArcGIS 10.3+.

#### Libraries
Diagrammer used the following third party libraries:
- SandBar by [DivElements](http://www.divelements.co.uk/net/),
- SandDock by DivElements, and
- ERM Diagram by Crainiate.

SandBar and SandBar can still be used but ERM Diagram no longer exists. This project has taken the initiative to re-enginer Diagrammer with Crainiate's open source successor called [Open Diagram](http://opendiagram.codeplex.com/). In its current state, the project does not compile. In addition to this, Open Diagram lacks ERM Diagram's layout functions.
